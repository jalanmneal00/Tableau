Week 7: Assignment where I had to explore the different functions on the software and given questions to answer on what each function represents and what they do.
Had other Tableau/R assignments stored in old pc, but this saved one demonstartes ability to navigate through Tableau in a short consise way.
week 9 & 10 are other assignments that showcase skills in visualizing and comparing data.
